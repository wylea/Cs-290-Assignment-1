        			This is the first time I've ever been able to make a website on my own, let alone coding in general since I   haven't taken many coding courses. So technically this would be the coolest thing so far!

       				I hope to learn more about websites so I would be able to host my own so I wouldn't have the need to buy  services in order to post whatever I want online on a website.
