			<strong>What challenges or troubles did you have completing this assignment. How did you work through them?</strong> 
			<ul>
				<em>answer:</em> I had to look up a bunch of stuff from lecture to make sure I understood what I needed to do for certain tags. Also I had to reasearch how to set up certain things for the paragraph tag, and I was worried about how to set up the image tag correctly. One of the other challenges, other than trying to figure out some basic HTML, was trying to figure out what was going wrong with my image tag for my index.html. So I put an image of a cat on my website but I wasn't able to put a picture of me on the website. I ended up trying another picture rather than trying to mess with it, and that ended up working. The next problem I had was handleing the bullet points and when they should end/begin. I had an intial website but I wasn't happy with how it turned out because I figured out that the < ul > tags don't need to end because HTML takes care of them. So I knew I was missing some tags somewhere but I didn't exactly know where so I didn't bother with it so I started over!

			<strong>What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?</strong>
			<ul>
				<em>answer:</em>  Well, to be honest I learned basically a whole lot, essentially the whole basics to HTML and a whole lot of formatting things that I should follow. One of the formatting things was to be very carful and <strong> neat</strong> with how you set up the website considering the tags don't need to be closed becase HTML is a language that doesn't need everything to be perfect to compile. Also I said neat by meaning to indent everything so you could see the levels to your code so that it's more readable. Also there are certain tags that wouldn't need a break tag such as the break tag. All you would need to do in this case is to put "< br >" and then it would break the page without any trouble.
