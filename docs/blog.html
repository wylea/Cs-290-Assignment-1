			<strong>What challenges or troubles did you have completing this assignment. How did you work through them?</strong> 
			<ul>
				<em>answer:</em> I had to look up a bunch of stuff from lecture to make sure I understood what I needed to do for certain tags. Also I had to reasearch how to set up certain things for the paragraph tag, and I was worried about how to set up the image tag correctly. One of the other challenges, other than trying to figure out some basic HTML, was trying to figure out what was going wrong with my image tag for my index.html. So I put an image of a cat on my website but I wasn't able to put a picture of me on the website. I ended up trying another picture rather than trying to mess with it, and that ended up working. The next problem I had was handleing the bullet points and when they should end/begin. I had an intial website but I wasn't happy with how it turned out because I figured out that the < ul > tags don't need to end because HTML takes care of them. So I knew I was missing some tags somewhere but I didn't exactly know where so I didn't bother with it so I started over!

			<strong>What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?</strong>
			<ul>
				<em>answer:</em>  Well, to be honest I learned basically a whole lot, essentially the whole basics to HTML and a whole lot of formatting things that I should follow. One of the formatting things was to be very carful and <strong> neat</strong> with how you set up the website considering the tags don't need to be closed becase HTML is a language that doesn't need everything to be perfect to compile. Also I said neat by meaning to indent everything so you could see the levels to your code so that it's more readable. Also there are certain tags that wouldn't need a break tag such as the break tag. All you would need to do in this case is to put "< br >" and then it would break the page without any trouble.

			<strong> What resources (e.g. specific web articles, the class Piazza forum, the TAs) were most helpful in completing this assignment? How did you use these resources? </strong>
			<ul>
				<em>answer:</em> I used the web articles posted on the class websites, those articles did very much help me with what I needed to do. Also Git and Github took some getting used to. So I refereced the Github documentation a lot so that I didn't have to refer to any other guides that weren't made from someone that may or may not have known Github (I wanted to trust a reliable easy to read source so I referenced Github :) ). I also found some help from my groupmates from my project that we were going to work on. Next, some other reasoureces I found really helpful was an editor that I have been using for C++ code! I personally use Sublime Text 3 for my coding before this class, but I found a way where it could be used for HTML editing, and it's been really nice because it would auto fill certain tags that I wouldn't know what went in them. Also this text is very graphically pleasing since the text is really nice and rounded, and certain key words are highlighted in certain colors to denote certain things. For instance, this editor has tags colored red, while there style tags that are colored light green, then yellow tags are fore quotations. I haven't encountered any other colored tags but this does help me denote which is which in trying to devlope my web page!
