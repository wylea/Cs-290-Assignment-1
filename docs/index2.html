<h2> What did I learn during this assignment?</h2>


<p> During this assignment there was a lot of elements that I've clearned about CSS. CSS is a nice tool to use for ordering things on your website in terms of the html. So when it comes down to relative positioning, the max/min width of things and all of those speical tags, they all work together to get you to your desired product. The one downside is that the code does exactly what you want it to, which is at times what we don't really want. One thing is to be slow and patient with your work since it takes time to be able style pages in a certain way. Another thing is to realize how many psuedo classes a certain element can have because it's important to the layout of the page that you get every single one. I think CSS is a fun language compared to other languages, for sure need to pay attention to how the spacing works for your webpage and understand that ceratin things can change widths and heights at all times when it comes to how buttons are formatted, or even article tags.</p>
